   - Optimization opportunities

### Configuration
The script uses a JSON configuration file:
```json
{
    "LogSettings": {
        "DefaultLogPath": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\LogFiles\\Firewall",
        "RetentionDays": 30,
        "MaxLogSize": "1GB",
        "Compression": true
    },
    "Analysis": {
        "ScanInterval": "1h",
        "ThreatThreshold": 10,
        "AlertEnabled": true,
        "PatternMatching": true
    },
    "Reporting": {
        "OutputPath": "C:\\FirewallReports",
        "Format": "HTML",
        "IncludeCharts": true,
        "EmailReport": true
    }
}
```
