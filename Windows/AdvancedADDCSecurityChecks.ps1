.SYNOPSIS
    Advanced security checks on an on-prem AD Domain Controller.

.DESCRIPTION
    - Verifies replication health (SYSVOL, DFSR).
    - Checks Kerberos policy for max ticket life, encryption.
    - Identifies unconstrained delegation usage.
    - Audits AdminSDHolder mismatch in protected groups.

.NOTES
    Requires: ActiveDirectory module
