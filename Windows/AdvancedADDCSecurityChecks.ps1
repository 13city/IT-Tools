.SYNOPSIS
    Advanced security assessment and compliance checks for Active Directory Domain Controllers.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script performs comprehensive security auditing and compliance checks on Active Directory Domain Controllers:
    - Verifies AD replication health status (SYSVOL, DFSR)
    - Audits Kerberos security policy configuration
    - Detects security vulnerabilities in delegation settings
    - Validates AdminSDHolder and protected group configurations
    - Monitors critical security events and changes
    - Generates detailed security assessment reports
    - Provides remediation recommendations
    - Ensures compliance with security best practices

.NOTES
    Author: 13city
    Compatible with: Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, 2022
    Requirements:
    - ActiveDirectory PowerShell module
    - Domain Controller role
    - Enterprise Admin or Domain Admin rights
    - Write access to log directory
    - PowerShell 5.1 or higher
    - RSAT AD DS and AD LDS Tools
    - Group Policy Management tools

.PARAMETER LogPath
    Directory where security assessment logs will be written
    Default: C:\Logs
    Creates timestamped log files with detailed findings
    Maintains history of previous security checks

.PARAMETER GenerateReport
    Switch to enable HTML report generation
    Creates comprehensive security assessment document
    Default: False

.PARAMETER ReportPath
    Path where HTML security report will be saved
    Only used when GenerateReport is enabled
    Default: [LogPath]\SecurityReport.html

.PARAMETER CheckInterval
    Frequency of recurring security checks in minutes
    Used for continuous monitoring mode
    Default: 60 minutes
    Minimum: 15 minutes

.PARAMETER AlertThreshold
    Number of security issues before triggering critical alert
    Used to determine overall security status
    Default: 5 issues
    Range: 1-100

.EXAMPLE
    .\AdvancedADDCSecurityChecks.ps1
    Runs basic security assessment with default settings:
    - Uses default log path (C:\Logs)
    - No HTML report generation
    - Single pass security check
    - Default alert thresholds

.EXAMPLE
    .\AdvancedADDCSecurityChecks.ps1 -LogPath "D:\Security\Logs" -GenerateReport
    Runs comprehensive security audit with reporting:
    - Custom log directory
    - Generates HTML security report
    - Includes remediation recommendations
    - Uses default thresholds

.EXAMPLE
    .\AdvancedADDCSecurityChecks.ps1 -CheckInterval 30 -AlertThreshold 3
    Runs continuous security monitoring:
    - Checks every 30 minutes
    - Alerts on 3 or more issues
    - Uses default logging location
    - No HTML report generation
