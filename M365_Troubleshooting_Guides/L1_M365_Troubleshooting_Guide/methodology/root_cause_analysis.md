## Analysis Framework

### 1.1 Five Whys Technique
1. **Initial Problem Statement**
   - Clear description
   - Observable symptoms
   - Impact statement
   - Timeline
   - Affected components

2. **Progressive Analysis**
   ```plaintext
   Example:
   - Why is the user unable to access SharePoint? 
     → Authentication failure
   - Why is authentication failing? 
     → Token validation error
   - Why is token validation failing? 
     → Certificate expired
   - Why was certificate expiry not detected? 
     → Monitoring gap
   - Why was there a monitoring gap? 
     → No certificate expiry alerts configured
   ```

### 1.2 Ishikawa (Fishbone) Analysis
1. **Categories**
   - People
   - Process
   - Technology
   - Environment
   - Management
   - Measurement

2. **Example Structure**
   ```plaintext
   Problem: Service Access Failure
   - People
     └ Training gaps
     └ Process knowledge
   - Technology
     └ Network issues
     └ Configuration errors
   - Process
     └ Change management
     └ Documentation
   ```

## Data Collection

### 2.1 Log Analysis
```powershell
# Collect authentication logs
$authLogs = Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-1) -EndDate (Get-Date) -Operations UserLoggedIn

# Review Azure AD logs
$aadLogs = Get-AzureADAuditSignInLogs -Filter "status/errorCode ne 0"

# Check service health history
$healthHistory = Get-ServiceHealth -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)
```

### 2.2 System State
1. **Configuration Review**
   ```powershell
   # Check tenant configuration
   Get-OrganizationConfig
   
   # Review security settings
   Get-OrganizationConfig | Select-Object *Security*
   
   # Examine sharing settings
   Get-SharingPolicy
   ```

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response times
   - Resource utilization
   - Network latency
   - Error rates
   - Capacity metrics

## Investigation Techniques

### 3.1 Timeline Analysis
1. **Event Correlation**
   ```powershell
   # Create timeline of events
   $timeline = @()
   $timeline += Get-AzureADAuditSignInLogs
   $timeline += Search-UnifiedAuditLog
   $timeline += Get-ServiceHealth
   
   # Sort by timestamp
   $timeline | Sort-Object CreationTime
   ```

2. **Change Correlation**
   - System updates
   - Configuration changes
   - Policy modifications
   - Environmental changes
   - User actions

### 3.2 Impact Chain Analysis
1. **Primary Effects**
   - Direct impact
   - Immediate consequences
   - User experience
   - Service availability
   - Data integrity

2. **Secondary Effects**
   - Downstream systems
   - Related services
   - Business processes
   - Security implications
   - Compliance impact

## Pattern Recognition

### 4.1 Historical Analysis
```powershell
# Review historical incidents
$pastIncidents = Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate (Get-Date).AddMonths(-6) -EndDate (Get-Date)

# Analyze patterns
$patterns = $pastIncidents | Group-Object Operations | 
    Sort-Object Count -Descending |
    Select-Object Name, Count
```

### 4.2 Trend Analysis
1. **Metrics Tracking**
   - Error frequencies
   - Performance trends
   - Usage patterns
   - Resource consumption
   - Security events

2. **Pattern Identification**
   - Time-based patterns
   - User-based patterns
   - Location-based patterns
   - Service-based patterns
   - Error-based patterns
