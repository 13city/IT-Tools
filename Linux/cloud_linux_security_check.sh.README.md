# cloud_linux_security_check.sh

### Purpose
Performs comprehensive security auditing specifically designed for cloud-hosted Linux instances, focusing on cloud-specific security concerns and best practices for major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).

### Features
- Cloud provider detection and specific checks
- Instance metadata security verification
- Cloud firewall rules validation
- Identity and access management audit
- Network security group verification
- Cloud storage permissions check
- Detailed logging of security findings

### Requirements
- Root or sudo access
- Cloud provider CLI tools (optional)
- Access to instance metadata service
- Standard Linux utilities
- Network access for API calls

### Usage
```bash
sudo ./cloud_linux_security_check.sh
```

### Security Checks Performed

1. **Cloud Provider Security**
   - Validates instance metadata service access
   - Checks cloud provider security groups
   - Verifies cloud firewall configurations
   - Audits cloud storage permissions

2. **Identity Management**
   - Checks IAM role assignments
   - Validates instance profile permissions
   - Verifies access key rotation
   - Audits service account permissions

3. **Network Security**
   - Validates VPC configurations
   - Checks network security groups
   - Verifies network interface settings
   - Monitors unusual network activity

4. **Storage Security**
   - Validates cloud volume encryption
   - Checks storage access permissions
   - Verifies backup configurations
   - Audits temporary storage usage

### Output Format
The script provides both real-time console output and logged results:
```
===== Starting Cloud Linux Security Check at [timestamp] =====
Cloud Provider: AWS
Metadata Service: IMDSv2 Enabled
Security Groups: Properly Configured
IAM Role: Valid and Active
Volume Encryption: Enabled
===== Cloud Linux Security Check Completed at [timestamp] =====
```

### Error Handling
- Validates cloud provider access
- Handles API rate limiting
- Reports cloud-specific errors
- Provides remediation suggestions

### Log File
The script maintains a detailed log at `/var/log/cloud_linux_security_check.log` containing:
- Timestamp of security checks
- Cloud provider details
- Security configurations
- Access permissions
- Network security status
- Recommended actions

### Customization
To customize the script:
1. Add checks for specific cloud providers
2. Modify security thresholds
3. Add custom cloud resource checks
4. Include provider-specific security policies

### Best Practices
- Run regularly as part of cloud monitoring
- Review cloud security group configurations
- Monitor instance metadata access
- Keep cloud provider tools updated
- Address security findings promptly
- Maintain proper access key rotation
- Regular backup verification
